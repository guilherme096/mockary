A feather weight mock data generator API
</p>

Extremely simple python API to generate mock data for your app using chatgpt openai model.

## Features

### Mock Data Generation

Using the config.ini file you can especify which fields a mock should contain and the context for it. The API will generate a mock data based on the context and the fields you specified.

### Caching/Saving Mock Data

If you don't want to generate the same mock data over and over again, you can save it to a file and load it later.
Also you can cache the mock data in memory to avoid generating it again in the same sessio in the same session.
